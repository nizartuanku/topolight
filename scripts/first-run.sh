# first-run.sh — the First User Test for TopoLight.
#
# This script does exactly what a first-time user does, in the same order, with
# nothing prepared in advance: it downloads the newest published release from
# GitHub, verifies the checksum, extracts it, starts the binary, and waits for
# the dashboard to answer. It writes only inside a throwaway directory under
# /tmp and it never needs root.
#
# Run it on a clean Ubuntu machine:
#
#     bash scripts/first-run.sh
#
# It prints PASS only if a first user would have a working dashboard in front
# of them, and it fails if that took longer than the budget below.
#
# Requirements: bash, curl, tar, sha256sum, python3 — all present on a stock
# Ubuntu Server install.
